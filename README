This is the version 0.2.1 of my Atari 800 emulator for Unix. My main
objective is to create a freely distributable portable emulator (i.e.
with source code available). It can be configured to run in the
following ways :-

	1. BASIC mode
	2. CURSES Mode
	3. SVGALIB for Linux Systems
	4. X-Windows
	5. CBM Amiga

The basic mode is only useful for running programs such as MAC65,
Atari Basic etc. I have had this version running on Linux,
SunOS 4.1.3, Solaris 2.4, VAX/VMS, CBM Amiga (Dice C and GNU C)
and the HP-UX 9000/380.

The CURSES mode is similar to the basic mode, but it also enables full
screen editing capability. Some computer don't seem to support curses
fully - SunOS 4.1.3, VAX/VMS, LINUX (but ncurses is OK).

The SVGALIB version runs at a reasonable speed. The screen dimensions
are limited to 320x200 and is unable to display the overscan modes.
Instead SVGALIB displays the core 320x192 pixels.

The X-Windows version supports graphics but runs *very* slowly. This
appears to be due to overheads with X-Windows.

The Amiga version supports graphics but currently lacks Paddle support.

Features
--------

Note: Not all features are supported on all platforms.

48K/52K Atari 400/800 emulation (optional RAM between 0xc000 and 0xcfff)
Atari 800XL emulation.
OSS Super Cartridges.
Should run on any Unix computer running X-Windows.
Wide / Normal / Standard Playfields.
Joystick controller using numeric keypad.
Paddle controller using X-Windows mouse position.
Display List Interrupts.
Vertical Blank Interrupts.
All Antic Display modes.
GTIA graphics support for *all* Antic modes (GTIA Characters etc.)
Player Missile Graphics with collision detection.
Character vertical reflect, invert and blank.
Files can be stored directly on your host computer via the H: device.
	(H: replaces the C: device which serves no useful purpose)
Reads both ATR and XFD disk files.
Disk swapping (Crude but works - needs to be improved)
PIL modes - allows memory between 0x8000 and 0xbfff to be toggled
between RAM and ROM.
Horizontal Fine Scrolling
Playfield and Player/Missile Priorities

Future Atari 800 Enhancements
-----------------------------

Vertical Fine Scrolling
Atari 800XE emulation.
Printer support (Print to file + spool on close).
Paged memory using PORTB.
More extensive sound support.

It should be possible to add support for non OSS Super Cartridges. If
you can forward details on how the cartridge works I'll see what I
can do.
