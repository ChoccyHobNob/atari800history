This is the version 0.6.0 of my Atari 800, 800XL, 130XE and 5200 emulator
for Unix, Amiga and MS-DOS. My main objective is to create a freely
distributable portable emulator (i.e. with source code available). It can
be configured to run in the following ways :-

	1. BASIC mode
	2. CURSES Mode
	3. SVGALIB for Linux Systems
	4. X-Windows + Optional XVIEW or MOTIF User Interface
	5. CBM Amiga
 	6. MS-DOS

The basic mode is only useful for running programs such as MAC65,
Atari Basic etc. I have had this version running on Linux,
SunOS 4.1.3, Solaris 2.4, Silicon Graphics, VAX/VMS, CBM Amiga
(Dice C and GNU C) and the HP-UX 9000/380.

The CURSES mode is similar to the basic mode, but it also enables full
screen editing capability. Some computer don't seem to support curses
fully - SunOS 4.1.3, VAX/VMS, LINUX (but ncurses is OK).

The SVGALIB version runs at a reasonable speed. The screen dimensions
are limited to 320x200 and is unable to display the overscan modes.
Instead SVGALIB displays the core 320x200 pixels. The area which is
displayed can be modified using the F11 and F12 keys.

The X-Windows version supports graphics and has an optional XVIEW
user interface. The Linux X Window version can be built with
joystick support (If joystick module is installed in the kernel).

The Amiga version supports graphics but currently lacks Paddle support.
