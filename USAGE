Keys during use
---------------

These keys will probably be regrouped into a better order. Not all
of the keys work for all versions.

F1	Warm Reset (This doesn't work under Open Windows)
F2	Option
F3	Select
F4	Start
F5	Cold Reset
F6	Toggle RAM/ROM between 0x8000 and 0xbfff (PIL Mode).
F7	Break Key
F8	Crude Disk 1 Changer

On the numeric keypad the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 keys are used
as joystick 0. The 0 key is the fire key.

Either ALT Key will operate as the Atari Key.

CTRL C breaks into the monitor. Execution can be resumed by typing CONT
at the prompt (Basic version only).

Unlike PC Xformer, I have not tried to emulate the exact keyboard layout,
instead, I have tried to make your native keyboard work as normal.

Note: It will run using two .XFD disks. It should work with upto eight,
      but I had trouble modifing DOS.
