Atari Basic
===========

Atari Basic is nolonger activated by the '-b' command line option.
It is now loaded in the same way as every other cartridge. This does
not affect the XL/XE version which has Atari Basic as standard.

	atari800 -rom object/ataribas.rom

Example 2 - Atari 800XL Emulator

	atari800 -xl

Keyboard + Joystick & Paddle Controllers
========================================

Unlike PC Xformer, I have not tried to emulate the exact keyboard layout,
instead, I have tried to make your native keyboard work as normal.

Note: The function keys will eventually be changed to a more logical
      order.

X11 Keyboard + Joystick & Paddle Controllers

`	This character replaces the CAPS lock key because I have not
	found a way of detecting it. A future solution maybe to
	automatically issue a CAPS lock key when a transition is
	made between lower and upper case keys. i.e. If svgalib
	return 'a' followed by 'A' it could send 'a' 'CAPS' 'A' to
	the Atari.

The CTRL+SHIFT keyboard combinations are implemented using the left
ALT key.

Joystick 0 is operated by the numeric keypad (make sure that the numeric
keypad has been enabled).

	7 8 9
	 \|/
	4 5 6
	 /|\
	1 2 3

	And 0 is the fire key.

At the moment it is not possible to use a Paddle with the SVGALIB version.
