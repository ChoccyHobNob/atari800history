Usage: 6502 [-atari] [-hprefix/] [-b] [-c] [-d] [-1..9]
            [disk1.xfd ... disk8.xfd]

-atari	Enable Atari 800 Emulation Mode [default]

-b	Enable BASIC ROM (Loaded from object/ subdirectory)
-1..9	Trade off between speed and screen refresh rate. The lower the
        number the more often the screen is refreshed and the slower the
        CPU emulation. :-(
-c	Enable RAM between $C000 and $CFFF
-d	Enable DEBUG Mode. Monitor is entered straight away. Only
	useful for basic version.
-h	Subdirectory for H device defaults to H/

	H1: Store files in native Atari Format
	H2: Convert linefeed to normal ASCII.

Keys during use
---------------

Note: These keys will probably be regrouped into a better order.

F1	Warm Reset (This doesn't work under Open Windows)
F2	Option
F3	Select
F4	Start
F5	Cold Reset
F6	Toggle RAM/ROM between 0x8000 and 0xbfff (PIL Mode).
F7	Break Key

On the numeric keypad the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 keys are used
as joystick 0. The 0 key is the fire key.

Either ALT Key will operate as the Atari Key.

CTRL C breaks into the monitor. Execution can be resumed by typing CONT
at the prompt (Basic version only).

Unlike PC Xformer, I have not tried to emulate the exact keyboard layout,
instead, I have tried to make your native keyboard work as normal.

Note: It will run using two .XFD disks. It should work with upto eight,
      but I had trouble modifing DOS.
