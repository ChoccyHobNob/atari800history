Installation of the Atari 800 Emulator
--------------------------------------

Firstly, I don't know the legal status of the Atari Operating System
or Atari Basic. I suggest that you obtain the images from the PC Xformer
package (do an archie search on xf25).

The files you need are 'ataribas.rom' and 'atariosb.rom' which should
then be placed under a directory called 'object' below the source
directory. At the moment the emulator must be executed from the
build directory.

Note: for case sensitive systems make sure that the filenames and
      directory are all lowercase.

X-Windows Version on a Unix Platform
------------------------------------

Just type make. It is configured for a double size screen. The smaller
screen can be selected by removing the -DDOUBLE_SIZE option from the
Makefile.

Note: You may have to add the X11 include directory to the CPPFLAGS line.
      On SunOS 4.1.3 and Solaris 2.4 it is /usr/openwin/include.

      i.e. CPPFLAGS = -I/usr/openwin/include -DX11

SVGALIB Version on Linux
------------------------

Uncomment the relevant section in the Makefile before typing make.

Note: The SVGALIB version must be either run as the root user or the
      executable must be owned by root and have its setuid bit set.

      To enable the program to be run by any user, login as root
      and type:-

		chown root 6502
		chmod 4755 6502

CURSES version for UNIX
-----------------------

Uncomment the relevant section in the Makefile before typing make -
If your using Linux make sure that you uncomment the NCURSES section.

Note: Some version of curses do not work. This is because they are
      missing a few functions (nodelay, attron, attroff, keypad and
      curs_set) and the keyboard pre-processor symbols are not
      defined within <cursor.h>. Two systems I know that are affected
      by this are SunOS 4.1.3 (Not Solaris 2.x) and Linux. Linux
      has another package called 'ncurses' that does not have this
      problem.

BASIC version on VAX/VMS (No Graphics)
--------------------------------------

type @vmsbuild

Compiling: Run the command file vmsbuild.com. It is set up to use
           GNU C (I used version 2.6.1 but don't expect problems
           with other versions). It will probably compile OK on
           VAX C.

6502 :== $DISK$xxxx:[yyyy]6502.exe

	where xxxx is the disk the software is on.
	      yyyy is the directory the software is in.

BASIC version for CBM Amiga (No Graphics)
-----------------------------------------

Uncomment the relevant section in the Makefile before typing make.
If your using dmake the makefile should be renamed dmakefile.

BASIC version for Unix (No Graphics)
------------------------------------

Uncomment the relevant section in the Makefile before typing make.
