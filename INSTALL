Installation of the Atari 800 Emulator
--------------------------------------

Firstly, I don't know the legal status of the Atari Operating System
or Atari Basic. I suggest that you obtain the images from the PC Xformer
package (do an archie search on xf25).

The files you need are 'ataribas.rom' and 'atariosb.rom' which should
then be placed under a directory called 'object' below the source
directory. At the moment the emulator must be executed from the
build directory.

Note: for case sensitive systems make sure that the filenames and
      directory are all lowercase.

X-Windows Version on a Unix Platform
------------------------------------

Just type make

BASIC version on VAX/VMS (No Graphics)
--------------------------------------

type @vmsbuild

Compiling: Run the command file vmsbuild.com. It is set up to use
           GNU C (I used version 2.6.1 but don't expect problems
           with other versions). It will probably compile OK on
           VAX C.

6502 :== $DISK$xxxx:[yyyy]6502.exe

	where xxxx is the disk the software is on.
	      yyyy is the directory the software is in.

BASIC version for CBM Amiga (No Graphics)
-----------------------------------------

Uncomment the relevant section in the Makefile before typing make.
If your using dmake the makefile should be renamed dmakefile.
