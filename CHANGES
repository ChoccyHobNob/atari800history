Changes in 0.1.2
----------------

- Now include <stdlib.h>  in atari_custom.h

- Resets count to countdown as soon as it reaches zero. This was causing
  problems with the RESET Key - count went negative.

- Removed XImage structure. I am now updating only the pixels that have
  changed within a Pixmap. XCopyArea is used to move the Pixmap onto
  the Window. XCopyArea is not called if no pixels are changed. As a
  result I am trying a higher refresh rate.

- Correction for BASIC version - I left some X11 stuff in resulting in
  unresolved sybols.

- Remove unused status variable from atari_h_device.c

- Added some test Amiga Intuition Code - not usable (No Colour or Keyboard)
  It manages to get the 'READY' prompt up! Atari Basic Blue is one colour
  and everything else is the other. When keyboard support is added you
  will be able to use Atari Basic.

- Registers are now allocated variables within atari_custom.c. They are
  nolonger stored in main memory area.

Changes in 0.1.1

- Outputs an error message when ROM images are not available.
