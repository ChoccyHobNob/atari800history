Bugs and Known Problems
-----------------------

2. A few programs cause the emulator to enter its built in debugger. The
   reason for this is unknown at the moment. It might be use of undocumented
   instructions. (Atari Tennis)

4. Antic Modes 2, 3 and f which display two true colours and not one
   colour with two luminances. Should this be called a bug or feature? -
   its easy to fix (for an example type POKE 709,40). Personally I
   *like* being able to get solid colour antic 2 characters on the
   blue background (e.g. RED on BLUE) but technically it's wrong.

5. Burried Bucks and Caverns of Khafka player to playfield collision
   detection is broken. This is a result of only refreshing the screen
   once every four frames. The collision detection indicates to the
   program that no collisions have occured during these skiped screens.
   Both Burried Bucks and Caverns of Khafka use this to drop something
   until the objects hits a playfield object. The result is that the
   object drops 3 out of 4 frames even when touching a playfield.

   + These programs work OK if you select a refresh rate of 1.

8. Player/Missiles are not displayed over a GTIA [sub]playfield -
   Not really a bug since its not been implemented yet!

9. The Linux XVIEW (a.out) version generates a segmentation faults when
   linked with the Network Audio System. The fault occurs simply by
   linking the NAS routines with the XVIEW version, you do not even
   need to execute a single line of code added to support sound. At the
   moment I believe that this is a conflict between the current version
   of XVIEW I am using (XVIEW 3.2 Linux Rel. 5 + X11R6) and the Network
   Audio System. XVIEW and NAS work OK together under Solaris and
   Linux/ELF.
